# Project 1 Tetris Game

<h2>The game</h2>
<p>Tetris is a very popular game created in the 80's. The game consists of 7 different pieces falling vertically and we have to fit them so that the horizontal lines are completed. Completing lines disintegrate and count points. As the game progresses the speed of the pieces ncreaes, thus getting harder with each passing time.</p>

<p>I made my version of the Tetris Game using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The game can played <a href="https://namiabe.github.io/Tetris-Game/">here</a></p>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sound when the pieces get set and background music.</li>
    <li>Time game</li>
    <li>Combo points</li>
    <li>Other commands (like a pause of the game)</li>
    <li>Some effects</li>
    <li>Game over animation</li>
</ul>
